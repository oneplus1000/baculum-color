# baculum-color

"Throughout thousands of generations, we have continuously shaped tools and technologies that allow us to recover and preserve essential aspects of our past. One such creation is Baculum. This theme, while modern in design, acts as a vessel for ancient principles of structure, order, and communication. It bridges the gap between the digital world and the deep-rooted human need for organization and clarity. Baculum encapsulates the wisdom passed down through generations, preserving it in a format that adapts to our current technological landscape. Through this product, we recover an understanding of fundamental patterns, offering a modern echo of the legacy built by those who came before us. Having said all that, we're joking. Baculum-color is just a simple dark theme."
